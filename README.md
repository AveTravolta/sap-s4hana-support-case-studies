# SAP S/4HANA Support Case Studies (Simulated)

This repository contains **simulated SAP S/4HANA support tickets** created to demonstrate entry-level ERP support skills, ticket investigation, root cause analysis, and resolution documentation.

The case studies focus on **common real-world SAP support scenarios**, including:
- Approval workflow delays (e.g., requisitions exceeding thresholds)
- Missing SAP Fiori tiles due to role or authorization issues
- User access and authorization errors

Each ticket follows a structured support format:
1. **User Issue** – what the user reported
2. **Investigation Steps** – how the issue was analyzed
3. **Root Cause** – why the issue occurred
4. **Resolution** – how the issue was addressed and documented
5. **Support Takeaways** – lessons learned for future scenarios

These simulations reflect how a **junior SAP or ERP support analyst** operates in real environments:
- Validating expected system behavior
- Identifying whether issues are user-specific or process-related
- Determining when escalation is required
- Communicating clearly and documenting effectively

> ⚠️ All scenarios are simulated. No system configuration or administrative access is represented.
